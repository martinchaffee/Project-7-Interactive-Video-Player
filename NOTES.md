# Project-7-Interactive-Video-Player
Treehouse FEWD Tech Degree Project 7

Ran into problems with my JS app to highlight text when the video plays. Asked a question on the Slack channel, and 
this is the response I got:

You’re right, your program is having problems in Safari, and it’s probably a browser issue. So what would that look like? I want you to answer as many of these questions to start:
- Which file is the problem in? The js file, the css file, or the html file?
- What is the name of the system that browsers give you to handle video?
- What elements, properties, or styles for video exist in some browsers and not others?
- What elements, properties, or styles exist in Firefox and chrome that don’t in Safari?
- Are you using any of these differences in your code?
There’s a couple of really good resources in the project notes to help with this. If you can’t answer a question I’ve listed, then write that, but please respond with as much as you can reason.
