          <span>Now that we've looked at the architecture
          of the internet. let's see how you might</span>
          <span>connect your personal devices to
          the internet inside your house.</span>
          <span>Well there are many ways to
          connect to the internet, and</span>
          <span>most often people connect wirelessly.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Let's look at an example of how
          you can connect to the internet.</span>

          <span>If you live in a city or a town,
          you probably have a coaxial cable for</span>

          <span>cable Internet, or a phone line if you
          have DSL, running to the outside of</span>

          <span>your house, that connects you to
          the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.</span>

          <span>If you live far out in the country,
          you'll more likely have</span>

          <span>a dish outside your house, connecting
          you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or</span>

          <span>you might also use the telephone system.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Whether a wire comes straight from
          the ISP hookup outside your house, or</span>

          <span>it travels over radio
          waves from your roof,</span>

          <span>the first stop a wire will make once
          inside your house, is at your modem.</span>

          <span>A modem is what connects the internet
          to your network at home.</span>

          <span>A few common residential modems are DSL or</span>
